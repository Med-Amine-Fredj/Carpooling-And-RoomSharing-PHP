# flatsharing-carpooling-PHP-ONLY
My first web project during my 1st year of computer engineering is a Carpooling/ Room Sharing with pure PHP, HTML, CSS with a W3school model...It's for absolute beginners, it contains posting  Carpooling/Room Sharing posts and comments and likes and also a chat group... This web application is for students of my university to help one another find roommates or carpooling to their city, home or university. (Including DB)
